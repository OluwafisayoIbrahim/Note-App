## Introduction

The React Note-Taking App is a simple web application designed for creating, editing, and managing notes. It provides a user-friendly interface to create and organize notes, tag them, and edit or delete them as needed. The app is built using React and various libraries such as React Router and React Bootstrap for a responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Users can create new notes with titles, markdown content, and tags.

- **Edit Notes**: Existing notes can be edited, including their titles, content, and associated tags.

- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete notes they no longer need.

- **Tagging**: Notes can be tagged for better organization. Tags can be created, edited, or deleted.

- **List View**: A list view displays all notes with their associated tags, making it easy to navigate and search for specific notes.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of multiple components and utilities:

- **App.tsx**: The main application component that ties everything together and provides the overall structure of the app.

- **useLocalStorage.ts**: A custom hook to interact with browser local storage to store notes and tags.

- **NoteList.tsx**: Component for rendering a list of notes and tags for navigation.

- **NoteLayout.tsx**: Component for displaying a single note's layout, including its details and edit options.

- **Note.tsx**: Component for viewing a single note, including its title, content, and tags.

- **EditNote.tsx**: Component for editing a single note's title, content, and tags.

- **NewNote.tsx**: Component for creating a new note with title, content, and tags.

## Getting Started

To get started with the React Note-Taking App, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the source code.

3. In the project directory, run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash```
   npm install
To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:

```bash```
npm start
This will start the app and open it in your default web browser.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use it to create, edit, and manage notes. Here are some key usage instructions:

Homepage: The homepage displays a list of all your notes along with their associated tags. You can click on a note to view its details, edit it, or delete it.

New Note: To create a new note, navigate to the "/new" route. Here, you can input the title, content, and tags for your new note.

Edit Note: When viewing a note, you have the option to edit it by navigating to the "/edit" route. Here, you can modify the note's title, content, and tags.

Tags: Tags can be managed through the interface by creating, editing, or deleting them. Tags help in organizing and categorizing notes.
